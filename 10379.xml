The corresponding sensor is identified with an object link.
Measurement Quality Indicator and Measurement Quality Level values provided in this object have a precedence over 
values provided in IPSO sensor object. If multiple object instances link to the same sensor object instance then 
the metadata provided by the largest instance id takes precedence.</Description>

0: UNCHECKED No quality checks were done because they do not exist or can not be applied. 
1: REJECTED WITH CERTAINTY The measured value is invalid. 
2: REJECTED WITH PROBABILITY The measured value is likely invalid.

                    <Description>Measurement quality level reported by a smart sensor. 
Quality level 100 means that the measurement has fully passed quality check algorithms. 
Smaller quality levels mean that quality has decreased and the measurement has only partially passed quality check algorithms. 
The smaller the quality level, the more caution should be used by the application when using the measurement. 
When the quality level is 0 it means that the measurement should certainly be rejected.</Description>
